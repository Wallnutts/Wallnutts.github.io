    title: My Interests
    excerpt: As a Maker, I believe in being a jack of all trades and learning as much as possible to broaden the scope of my projects, their workmanship, reliability and **WOW** factor. <br> <br> I have dabbled in many areas such as Leatherworking, Sowing, Woodworking, Carving and many more! However, I do find myself more inclined towards Retro and Techy hardware. <br> <br> I like to take matters in my own hands to modify, upgrade or take apart ( and problaby wreck ) existing products out of morbid curiosity. <br> <br> You would problaby find me in my room deep in my works hammering away at my keyboard or breathing in solder fumes ( nasty! ) while I CAD out my next project.
