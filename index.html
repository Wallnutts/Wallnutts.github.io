    title: About me
    excerpt: "Although I major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I believe that an engineer should also have additional skillsets to add to their toolbelt to expand the scope of projects that one can make. <br><br> Since young I had access to various tools and a huge bag of materials my parents kept. This allowed me to tinker endlessly through my growing years right into adulthood, where my itch for making new interesting things spurs me on to acquire new skillsets to add into my repertoire. <br>"
    skills: "
    **Coding** - Python ( CV, Scripting ) C++ ( Electronics, Microcontroller Applications ) Web design ( HTML, CSS ) <br> 
    **Building** - Electronics, Woodworking, Leatherworking, Sowing, Product Design <br> 
    **CAD** - Fusion360, Sketchup, Eagle <br> 
    **Production** - Da Vinci Resolve, Inkscape <br> 
    **+ Many More!**"
