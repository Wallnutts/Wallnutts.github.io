## **Research Staff for Singapore Polytechnic and Singapore Indoor Farms**
*September 2021 to April 2022*

I was a hardware and AI specialist in a team developing automated IOT farming racks for industrial purposes at Singapore Indoor Farms. I managed to develop the electrical wiring and physical designs as well as a leaf detection AI leveraging the faster AI capabilities of FPGAS, mainly using the ZYBO Z7 and the Ultra96. The end result was a smart farming rack with Firebase logging, remote control, camera monitoring as well as automated timer-based light control.

I also started development on a modular and scalable proof of concept system. This is done by using a main server to run a customised version of Homeassistant on a Raspberry Pi controlling multiple individual nodes of ESP32 farming racks allowing for low-cost implementation.
