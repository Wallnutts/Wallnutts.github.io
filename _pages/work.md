## **Research Staff for Singapore Polytechnic and Singapore Indoor Farms**
*September 2021 to April 2022*

I was part of a team developing automated IOT farming racks for industrial purposes at Singapore Indoor Farms. My role in this was as a hardware and AI specialist. I was able to develop the electrical wiring, physical designs. I was also able to develop a leaf detection AI leveraging the faster AI capabilities of FPGAS, mainly using the ZYBO Z7 and the Ultra96. The end result was a farming rack that was able to make use of Firebase to log various sensor readings and allow for remote control and camera monitoring as well as automated timer-based light control.

I was also able to stay on for an extra period of time to continue developing a modular and highly scalable proof of concept system. This is done by using a main server to run a customised version of Homeassistant on the Raspberry Pi controlling multiple individual nodes of ESP32 farming racks.
