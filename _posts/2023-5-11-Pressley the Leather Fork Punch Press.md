# Introduction

![](/assets/images/postphotos/pressly/punching.gif "Punching")

A major part of the stitching process during leather working is punching stitch holes into leather. Usually done with a fork punch and mallet, it can be really loud especially for my neighbours as I lives in an apartment building. Hence I always found this part of the process a hassle as I would have to bring my whole setup downstairs when hammering so that I would not disturb them. 

This project is a solution for that. I felt that it could be possible to combine a arbor press with a leather fork punch to allow for easy, precise and quieter holepunching in a nice and cheap DIY 3D printed package. Given the strength of such plastic components, I thought at first that it would be more realistic to modify an existing arbor press to fit a fork punch but the size (>$100!) and cost of a regular metal one was a huge turn off. So I thought that it would make for a fun and good challenge as well as an experiment in pushing the strength of 3D printed plastic.

# Printing + Assembly

![](/assets/images/postphotos/pressly/herringbone.png "gears")

Pressly's mechanism is very simple, consisting of a rack and pinion assembly using a herringbone gear profile. This is to maximise the contact area and shear strength of the print as they are the most critical parts in ensuring smooth operation. Both are reccomended to be printed in PETG/ABS at 6 walls >30% infill flat on the bed so that the teeth dont shear apart at the printing lines.
