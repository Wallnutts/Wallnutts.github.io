Due to size constraints, I was having part cooling problems for my Voron V0. I went through multiple extruder designs but none of them provided adequate part cooling. I found that most if not all of the 3rd party extruders use those small and thin <5mm thick blower fans that dont provide enough airflow to cool down the prints. This design that I found uses a pretty unique solution, where a large 5015 blower fan is gutted and retrofitted on top of the extruder with fan ducts that route the airflow to both sides.

I had to cut around the shell of the 5015 blower fan which was surprisingly easy.

For the extruder I used the "Roundhouse Extruder" that the creator reccomended. I was impressed by how well it was designed with how easy it was to print and assemble. However, I slightly edited the 3D model so that the PTFE tubing friction fits into the opening as I didnt want to use a PTFE coupler. I also made the extruder arm larger for more strength.

Hopefully I plan to remix this extruder setup even further with LED lights, a nozzle camera and perhaps a 4010 heatbreak fan instead of the loud 3010 one.
