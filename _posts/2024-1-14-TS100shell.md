My TS100 soldering iron case melted and broke hence I made this replacement. Despite using PLA, it holds up pretty well since the back end of the iron doesnt get very hot. I also set it up such that it automatically turns off when put down after 10 seconds so that it would not overheat.

Top part uses an M3 screw with heat insert to hold the iron tips instead of the flimsy allen screw in the original.

Top and bottom uses small self tapping screws i found laying around to fit together.
