Small Form factor (SFF) PCs are boring. Glorified metal cubes with the occasional splash of wood grain. Sure, they look clean and neat on your table but they look like every other metal box out there. If you are going out of your way to spend a premium on SFF components why not add some creativity and flair? 

This is where is where I throw my hat into the ring with my take on a SFF Case. Meet "Toasty":

Inspired by retro styled radios and toasters, Toasty measures at 260 X 260 X 174 mm and features interchangeable front/side panels to suit your preferences. For mine, I added a side panel that integrates a small SPI LCD to show PC stats or Spotify now playing screen that the set of switches toggles.

# Assembly

Heres a gist of how the whole assembly comes together:

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/toasty_overall_assembly_looped.gif "Overall Assembly")

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/spine_assembly_looped.gif "Spine Assembly")


## Print Settings

Printed with a 0.6mm nozzle, total print time takes about 2 days with ~750g PLA and ~120g PETG. Although I would recommend u might as well print the whole thing in PETG. 

Print everything out in the "Main components" folder. You have 2 choices for side panels under "Side panels" and 2 choices for front panels under "Front panels".

I turned ironing on for all side and front panels for a nice smooth outer finish.

Use paint on supports on these edges below and be sure to select "For support enforces only" for supports. I did this so that I wont need to waste filament on the bridges in the print.

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Shell Supports")

Everything else should be pretty easy to print.

## Heat inserts

Im using M3 OD3.6 / L5.7 and M4 OD6.6 / L5 Heat inserts that the holes of model is modelled after. You can problaby get away with using similar sized ones. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Shell Supports")

These are all the locations for M4 Heat inserts:

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "M4 Inserts")

For this part in particular I used some double sided tape to hold it in place and then heat set the insert in to that both pieces are stuck together. I then used hotglue to hold the external I/O circuit board in place.

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "I/O Board")

These are all the locations for M3 Heat inserts:

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "M3 Inserts")

## Melting parts together

This part is pretty sketchy, you could problaby use glue for this but I didnt have any on hand so I used a soldering iron. I have a TS100 temperature adjustable one on hand so I did all this at 220C to eliminate fumes.

The side panels and front panels need to be melted together like so.

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Front Panel")

## Mix-n-match switches and LEDs

I didnt model this in CAD at the time as I was still deciding on the switches to use. This whole area is drilled and sanded out and its really up to u what configuration you want to use depending also if you want to include the Pi-Zero + Screen configuration. I won't describe much as its pretty standard GPIO stuff. Your keywords are - 330 Ohm Pullup Resistors for the switches and 10K Ohm resistors for the LED.

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Wiring Diagram")

## Pi-Zero + SPI screen display

**This part is still a a work in progress!**
I found that my Pi Zero W was too slow to render webpages pages fast enough to switch between tabs and I currently am unable to get ahold of a Pi Zero W 2. My switches do not work yet and it only shows the spotify now playing page on startup.

SPI display is wired up according to this diagram. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "SPI Display")

I used FullpageOS for the main operating system as it is used for loading up and displaying any webpage on boot without any prior setup. This can be found in the Raspberry Pi Imager app under Other specific-purpose OS. You would still need to install python and the [fbcp-ili9341](https://github.com/juj/fbcp-ili9341) drivers for the display to work. More info can be found in my DeskTV guide under ["Software Portion"](/DeskTV/#software-portion).

# Bringing it all together

At this point you can put in all your components. Take note that the pcie riser is screwed in like so. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "PCIE Riser")

I also taped up the pcie riser so that it won't catch onto the shell during assembly later on. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "PCIE Riser")

Heres the completed spine assembly. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Spine Assembly")

Fitting the shell in is pretty finnicky but heres how I did it. You have to "hook" the shell over the GPU power cables and slowly slide the shell over the whole spine assembly. 

![](/assets/images/postphotos/toasty/shell_supports.jpg "Putting it all together")

Then screw in the front panel to finish the PC.

Congrats for making it through the whole guide and do enjoy your new Toasty! Make sure to share your version of Toasty around!
