Small Form factor (SFF) PCs are boring. Glorified metal cubes with the occasional splash of wood grain. Sure, they look clean and neat on your table but they look like every other metal box out there. If you are going out of your way to spend a premium on SFF components why not add some creativity and flair? 

This is where is where I throw my hat into the ring with my take on a SFF Case. Meet "Toasty":

I took a lot of inspiration from retro styled radios and toasters. Toasty measures at 260 X 260 X 174 mm and features interchangeable front/side panels to suit your preferences. For mine, I added a side panel that integrates a small SPI LCD to show PC stats or Spotify now playing screen that the set of switches toggles.
