A simple desk toy for you to stare at while it goes. Originally a sculpture designed by [Arthur Ganson](https://www.arthurganson.com/roller-chain-1), this is a motorized remix of a 3D printed version by [davemoneysign](https://www.printables.com/model/273818-desktop-machine-with-roller-chain). 

Instructions are available in the [Printables](https://www.printables.com/social/278875-wallnutts/models) link!
