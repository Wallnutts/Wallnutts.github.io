Damn do I love lists

## Printing Requirements:

For best results use a 0.6mm nozzle at 0.4mm layer height to achieve shorter printing times as the models are optimised to make use of such.

Included is an optional test piece to see if ur printer can handle it you pussy.

### Spine:

MUST be printed in PETG! This is the main load bearing piece all components are attached to. Since its pretty tall and thin model, try to orient it such that it doesnt shake as much for best print quality.

My printer is a bed slinger so I oriented the print as such:

### Shell - feet/nofeet:

PETG optional. After slicing the walls on ur shell should be exactly 4 layers thick without any gap fill. The notches should also be a uniform unbroken print line. 

Print time of the shell should be >12 hours depending on ur speed. Mine was 11h30m at 40mm/s.

### Modular Panels:

PETG optional. Total of 4 - left, right, top and front panel. 

Each Panel with exception of front ( solid piece ) is generated using the supplied models with top/bottom layers turned off and the infill pattern set as desired. Do change the parameters of each panel as u see fit! The advantage is of course customisablility and fast print time.

Im using 4 walls 10% Grid infill, resulting in 12 grams and 18 mins print time.
